# LibreDebate
This is a template and configuration file intended to be used by debaters at both the high school and college level. This allows debate to be easier on LibreOffice on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows. If there are any changes you would like, feel free to suggest them. I am completely new to any Git repository so also feel free to tell me if I f***ed anything up.
## Prerequisits
All you need is a computer and LibreOffice. I have only tested this with 5.3, but it should work on other versians.
LibreOffice can be found [here](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/)
## Installing
This depends heavily on your OS. I primarily use Linux, but I have tested this on a Windows machine as well. The summary of this is just put the libreoffice file in place of your current one in your configuration files under the same name. Then you have to put the template in Templates/Styles.
#### Linux
1. Download and install LibreOffice.
2. Run LibreOffice Writer, then close.
3. Download the folder named libreoffice and the file named Debate1.ott
4. Locate `~/.config` and then replace the current file named libreoffice with the one you downloaded.
   - Warning! all your settings for LibreOffice will be lost!
5. Locate `~/Templates/Styles` and put Debate1.ott inside. if this path does not exist, create it.
6. Done! Tada!
#### Windows
1. Download and install LibreOffice.
2. Run LibreOffice Writer, then close.
3. Download the folder named libreoffice and the file named Debate1.ott
4. Locate your Roaming folder, and replace LibreOffice with the one you downloaded. You may have to rename the one you downloaded to match the one in the folder, whatever it is, just make it the same.
   - Warning! all your settings for LibreOffice will be lost!
5. Locate your Documents folder, then create a folder named Templates in that, then inside that make one named Styles. Finally inside that, place Debate1.ott
6. Done! Tada!
7. PS. Im only kind of sure for this one so feel free to report problems.
#### Mac OS
1. No Idea! Never done it. It theoretically should work, but I cannot confirm that. I would assume the install process would closely resemble the Linux install. Good luck!
